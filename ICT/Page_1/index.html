        Code Implementation
      </h>
      <p class="p1">  
        &#8226; We used talis linux so we become anonymous, we used Tor browser because its the only way to go through the dark web , the special thing about Tor is that you get protection by changing your IP address.

      <p class="p1">  
        &#8226; To be able to enter sites in the dark web we used something called the hidden wikki, dark web sites has about 50-60 characters so the site link wont be memorisible which allow more secure

        What is the dark web
      </h>
      <p class="p1">&#8226; The dark web was by the U.S government to transfer 
        data privately but it was private till 2006
         so that million of users is using it 
        to increase the level of anonyoums00, 
        especially for activists or journalist
        s in oppressive regions. It emerged
         through technologies like Tor (The Onion Router), which
         encrypts internet traffic to keep identities hidden.

      <h class="hd1">How dangerous is it to browse the dark web for normal users</h>
      <p class="p1">&#8226; Using Tor without precautions or a secure system like Tails to browse
        illegal sites is very risky. Your real IP address could be exposed, and
        accessing illegal content can lead to legal trouble. Additionally, many
        dark web sites spread malware, and without proper security, your
        activities could be traced back to you.

        How dangerous is it to browse in the dark web
      </h>
      <p class="p1">  
        Browsing the dark web can be dangerous for several reasons. It exposes you to illegal content, scams, and potential cyberattacks. Some sites may try to steal personal information or spread malware. Additionally, engaging in illegal activities can lead to legal consequences. Always proceed with caution and avoid risky behavior.
